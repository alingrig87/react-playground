## Handling lists and keys

**Testimonials Component:**

- Fetch the testimonials data from the backend using an asynchronous call, such as an API request.
- Store the fetched data in the component's state, such as an array of testimonials.
- Render the testimonials list dynamically by mapping over the array of testimonials and creating a Testimonial component for each item.
- Assign a unique key to each Testimonial component using a unique identifier from the fetched data. This helps React efficiently update the list when changes occur.
- Display the necessary information from each testimonial, such as the author, content, and rating.

**Services Component:**

- Fetch the services data from the backend using an asynchronous call, such as an API request.
- Store the fetched data in the component's state, such as an array of services.
- Render the services list dynamically by mapping over the array of services and creating a Service component for each item.
- Assign a unique key to each Service component using a unique identifier from the fetched data. This helps React efficiently update the list when changes occur.
- Display the necessary information from each service, such as the title, description, and price.
