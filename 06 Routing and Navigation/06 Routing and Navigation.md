## Routing and Navigation

Certainly! Here are the routing and navigation requirements for the components mentioned in the Dentist Clinic application:

**Routing:**

- Set up routes for the following components: Home, Services, Testimonials, BookAppointment, and ContactForm.
- Each component should have a corresponding route path, such as `/`, `/services`, `/testimonials`, `/book-appointment`, and `/contact`.
- Configure the routing system to render the appropriate component when the corresponding route is accessed.

**Navigation:**

- Create a navigation bar component that displays links to navigate between different sections of the application.
- Include navigation links for Home, Services, Testimonials, Book Appointment, and Contact.
- Each navigation link should be clickable and direct the user to the corresponding route when clicked.
- Highlight the active link based on the current route to provide visual feedback to the user.
- You can use a navigation library like React Router or create a custom navigation component using plain React.

By implementing routing and navigation, users can easily navigate through different sections of the Dentist Clinic application and access the desired information or perform actions, enhancing the overall user experience.
