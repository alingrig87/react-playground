# Javascript Refresher

1. Var Let Const:

   - Exercise 1: Declare a variable using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Assign a value to each variable and try to reassign them later. Observe the differences in behavior.
   - Exercise 2: Explain the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in a web development project and provide concrete examples of situations where each is more suitable.

2. Objects:

   - Exercise 1: Create an object called `person` that contains information about a person such as name, age, and occupation. Access and display this information.
   - Exercise 2: Define a method in the `person` object that calculates and displays the person's birth date based on their age. Use the `Date()` method to get the current date.

3. This Keyword:

   - Exercise 1: Create a `calculator` object with a `value` property initialized to 0 and `add()` and `subtract()` methods that update the value. Use `this` to access and update the `value` property.
   - Exercise 2: Explain the behavior of the `this` keyword in JavaScript and provide examples of situations where it is useful in programming.

4. Arrow Function:

   - Exercise 1: Write a function using arrow function syntax that takes a number as input and returns its square.
   - Exercise 2: Compare the differences between a regular function and an arrow function and explain the advantages and disadvantages of using each.

5. Array Methods:

   - Exercise 1: Create an array of numbers and use the `map()` method to double each number in the array.
   - Exercise 2: Use the `filter()` method to filter an array of objects and return only the objects that meet certain conditions, such as a specific age criterion or a certain attribute.

6. Destructuring:

   - Exercise 1: Given an object `person` with properties like name, age, and city, use destructuring to extract and store the values of these properties into separate variables.
   - Exercise 2: Create a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns an object with the minimum and maximum values using array destructuring.

7. Spread:

   - Exercise 1: Write a function that takes multiple arguments and returns their sum using the spread syntax to combine the arguments into an array.
   - Exercise 2: Given two arrays, use the spread operator to combine them into a single array.

8. Rest:

   - Exercise 1: Write a function that takes a variable number of arguments using the rest parameter syntax and returns their sum.
   - Exercise 2: Given an array of numbers, use the rest operator to extract the first element and store the remaining elements in a separate array.

9. Classes:

   - Exercise 1: Create a `Person` class with properties like name and age, and a method to introduce themselves. Instantiate a few `Person` objects and call the method.
   - Exercise 2: Extend the `Person` class to create a `Student` subclass with additional properties like grade and a method to display their grade. Test it by creating a few `Student` objects.

10. Modules:

- Exercise 1: Create a module that exports a function to calculate the area of a circle. Import the module in another file and use the function to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius.
- Exercise 2: Create a module that exports multiple utility functions, such as calculating the square of a number and finding the length of a string. Import and use these functions in another file.

11. Primitive Reference:

- Exercise 1: Create two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign them the same number value. Modify the value of `b` and observe the effect on `a`.
- Exercise 2: Create a function that takes an array as input, modifies one of its elements, and observe the changes in the original array.
